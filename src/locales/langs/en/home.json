Word pattern analysis detected repetitive structures and predictable word choices characteristic of AI models. Our sentence structure deviation model showed significant deviations from human writing. Semantic depth measurement revealed superficial content and limited contextual depth. Model residue scanning found characteristic traces of popular AI models. Author score calculation detected high AI probability in each sentence evaluation. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we conclude that the text was most likely generated by an AI model.
